# event-admin-info
* used NestJs on backend, because node is good at handling connections and I am familiar with specified framework
* I used mongo as DB, because I wanted nosql DB and mongo was obvious choice for javascript backend
* FE is written by vue.js, I used some free theme that hade vue and tailwind. Reused mainly layout.
* Everything is only proof of work, not production ready code. More needs to be done, for example hide credentials on BE, error handling, caching, components reusability, more general query params (not handcoded), etc

# set-up
* firsty install dependencies for both services
* start BE by ```$ npm run start```, FE by ```npm run dev```
